<h2>Intro</h2>
      

      <p>Like many other cultures, lots of traditions are centered around food. For example, what foods are prepared on certain holidays, or reaching the age where one now must spend time with their mother to learn how to make the native dishes. 
      </p>
      
      <p>What I always found so beautiful about when Cameroonians cook is, they rarely ever follow written recipes or measurements. Somehow, every ingredient and method, is lodged into the brain.</p>

      <p>My earliest memories of Cameroon is when my mother would wake me up early in the morning to go plant different types of crops in our plot. One of the things I miss the most about Cameroon is, we grew most of what we ate. Inever thought much of it when I was a child, but to have that experience again, would be so gratifying.</p>

      <p>In this site, I hope to share with you a little glimpse of a big part of Cameroonian culture--its food. I often find myself in moments of nostalgiaâ€”deeply missing the place I call home, so I guess this project is just as much for me, as it for you. </p>
