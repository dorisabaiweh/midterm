      	<p>Jollof Rice is a staple in Cameroon and other west African countries—its basically a west African version of pilaf or paella. This one-pot dish consists of rice (of course), tomatoes, tomato paste, peppers, onions, garlic, spices, and [usually] some sort of meat.  The dish is usually made spicy, but the spices can be varied to suit your palate.</p>
      </div>
     <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
     <ul>
	<li>250 millilitres long grain rice (thoroughly washed in a sieve with cold water)</li>
	<li>2 large onions (roughly chopped)</li>
	<li>1 medium bell pepper (chopped)</li>
	<li>2 cloves garlic (grated)</li>
	<li>4 tablespoons of oil</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
	<li>2 tablespoons tomato puree</li>
	<li>1 pinch of pepper</li>
	<l1>2 broth cubes (any will do - ideally one chicken, one beef)</li>
	<l1>1 tinned tomatoes</li>
	<l1>250 millilitres water</li>
	</ul>
	<div class="method">
		<h3>Method:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>1. Preheat oven to 300F</li>
			<li>2. In a medium sized pan, add 2 tbsp of the oil and heat over a medium heat. Add the onions, peppers and dried chilli flakes and cook for 4-5 minutes until started to cook. Then grate in garlic and cook for a minute while stirring.</li>
			<li>3. Stir in the chilli powder, cumin, paprika and pepper and cook, while stirring, for 2 minutes. It will appear as though the spices coat the pan - that is fine. Crumble in the stock cubes and cook for a further minute.
			</li>
			<li>4. Stir through the tomato puree, then immediately add the tinned tomatoes and water (once can is empty, re-fill with water and pour into pan).</li>
			<li>5. Bring to a a gentle simmer, stirring to de-glaze/dislodge any spices at the bottom, and taste for spice & seasoning - adjust accordingly.</li>
			<li>6. Fold in the washed rice, bring to just under a simmer and stir through the remaining oil (this will prevent sticking).</li>
			<li>7. Cover pan with tinfoil and it's lid, then place in the preheated oven. Cook for 20-25minutes or until all liquid is absorbed and rice cooked. Stirring is only required at the end - dish is best left untouched while cooking.</li>
			<li>8. After 20 mins, take out of oven and unveil. There will be a layer of concentrated tomato on top. This can be stirred through the rice when you're checking if it's cooked.</l1>
			<li>9. If the rice still isn't cooked, lid on and back in for another 5 mins; or if the rice appear too wet/stodgey, place back in the oven without the lid.</li>
			<li>10. Leave to stand for 2 mins, lid on, before serving.</li>

   	<p>Puff is a spongy, deep-fried  West African snack—much similar to a donut. In Cameroon, it’s perhaps the most common street food. The basic ingredient consists of flour, sugar, yeast, water, salt and oil for deep frying.</p>	
   </div>
   	<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
   
   	<ul>
   		<li>2 cups warm water</li>
   		<li>2¼ teaspoon active dry yeast (1 packet)</li>
   		<li>3½ cups flour</li>
   		<li>3½ cups flour</li>
   		<li>½ Tbs salt</li>
   		<li>Oil for deep frying</li>
   	</ul>
   <div class="method">
   	<h3>Method:</h3>
   	<ul>
   		<li>1. Mix salt, sugar, water, and yeast. Set aside for 5 minutes</li>
   		<li>2. Add flour and mix.</li>
   		<li>3. Let the mixture rise for approximately 1- 2 hours</li>
   		<li>4. In a large, sauce pan pour vegetable oil into a pot, until it is at least 3 inches (or about 5 centimeters) high (too little will result in flatter balls), and place on low heat.</li>
   		<li>5. Test to make sure the oil is hot enough by putting a ‘drop’ of batter into the oil. If it is not hot enough, the batter will stay at the bottom of the pot rather than rising to the top</li>
   		<li>6.	Using your hands grab a little bit of mixture at time and drop in the oil.</li>
   		<li>7. When the oil is hot enough, use a spoon to dish up the batter, and another spoon or spatula to drop it in the oil, sort of in the shape of a ball.</li>
   		<li>8.	Fry for a few minutes until the bottom side is golden brown.</li>
   		<li>9. Turn the ball over and fry for a few more minutes until the other side is golden brown.</li>
   		<li>10. Use a large spoon or something like that to take it out of the oil. I usually place them on napkins right away to soak up some of the excess oil.</li>
   		<li>11. If desired, you can roll the finished product in table sugar or powdered sugar to make it sweeter</li>

   		<li>9. Cook for 10 more minutes, then add the spinach.</li>
   		<li>10. Serve with rice or boiled plantains, or yams.</li>
