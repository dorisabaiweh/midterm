      <p> My family and I left Cameroon about 11 years ago and moved to the U.S. Since then, I've been residing in Washington D.C. with my family until a couple years ago when I moved to NYC for school. Since leaving D.C., there are many moments in which I desperately miss home and miss the food because I no longer have the convenience of having my mother prepare the food. It is this longing which is what inspired this site. With these for recipes, I hope to share the intricateness of Cameroonian food, and how beautiful that can be.</p> <p>For further inquiries about recipes, feel free to email me at: abaid345@newschool.edu</p>
